Simple web app where we can view post, edit, delete and insert posts.

Technologies used:
	1- HTML
	2- CSS
	3- JavaScript
	4- Flask
	5- MySql

Third Party Libraries:
	1- w3.css

Here we used flask as an backend

Errors:
	1- No validation for forms
	2- Poor design and layouts.
	3- No adding friends (we can view all users posts)
	4- No image/ media inserting
	5- No profesional editor

Future inhancement:
	1- Add class form validation
	2- Improve css layout
	3- Make it like facebook so we can add friends
	4- Used storage to insert media
	5- Use ckeditor
